What is it?

A personal experimentation project that started in 2019 with the goal of 
exploring implementation methods of a stack-based programming language 
inspired by Forth. 

It's a work in progress currently undergoing refactoring.

Goals:
- Generate just-in-time code from dictionary definitions (stack procedures) 
  entered in a REPL
- Add strong typing over the procedures
- ?
